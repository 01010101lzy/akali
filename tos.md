# Terms of Service

> Updated: Dec. 2018

This document of Terms of Service should apply to all users who uses the vanilla Akali software platform.

## Terms

In the sentences below,

"Akali" refers to the website set up by the developers of Akali (if present), AND any other website running vanilla (unmodified) Akali versions. This does not include websites running modified versions of Akali.

"Akali's administrators" and "the administrators" refers to the group of people or bots who have access to Akali's admin API. They are the true controllers of the website.

## Rules

By using Akali and/or its components, you, the user, agrees on the following rules:

- The administrators of Akali have the right to modify or delete your account, as well as all contents posted to Akali.

- Akali and its administrators have the rights to recommend contents posted by you to other users, via features similar to "related contents", "more content the user likes" and/or "content of the day".

## Privacy

Akali will not disclose your IP address, email address, passwords or any automated email sent between you and servers running Akali. Akali's administrators have the rights to see these information, but not allowed to disclose them.

You, the user, have the rights to choose what other information (including email) of yourself can/should be displayed in your profile.

You can either ask the administrators, or use the APIs to export all your user data, and/or delete your account.

## Account

Akali offers API keys for every account. You may use your own account with bots and/or automated scripts, but we encourage you setting up and using an exclusive account for your bot. This "bot account" will be marked "bot" in all places it appears in.

You have the right to modify and delete any bot accounts created by yourself or associated to you. If you delete your account, any bot account associated solely to you will also be deleted.

## Copyright

Akali does not own any copyright of the contents uploaded by users. If you consider that some content infringes your copyright, or is inappropriate for some purpose, please contact the administrators to take them down.
