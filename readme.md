## FAQ

### Why use Dart? Shouldn't you use Go or something like that?

Because Dart is easy (and fluent!) to write while still having a relatively high performance (compared to, maybe, PHP and older solutions?). We may consider rewriting this project or create another compatible project using Go, but Dart is enough for now.

## License

Akali is released under MIT license. Though, we recommend you to open-source your own fork of Akali for sharing.

p.s. Akali is preferably pronounced `/'akaï¹‘lai/`, with the "i" pronouncing `/ai/` like that in the word "alkali" (which is also where this name came from).
