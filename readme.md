**AKALI IS TOTALLY UNUSABLE FOR NOW!**

**IMPORTANT!** 
Akali is currently under heavy development. 
Things could break between commits, or the whole program may not be able to work at all. 
Please use at your own risk.

Akali is an experimental _scalable and expandable_ pic site (booru) server written in Dart.

## Usage

$ dart lib/main.dart [options]

Will introduce better run methods in the future.

## FAQ

### Why use Dart? Shouldn't you use Go or something like that?

Because Dart is easy (and fluent!) to write while still having a relatively high performance (compared to, maybe, PHP and older solutions?). We may consider rewriting this project or create another compatible project using Go, but Dart is enough for now.

## License

**Akali is released under MIT license**, which means you could use it for commercial projects. 
Though, we recommend you to open-source your own fork of Akali for a better environment.

p.s. Akali is preferably pronounced `/'aka﹑lai/`, with the "i" pronouncing `/ai/` like that in the word "alkali" (which is also where this name came from).
